# Common Causes for Error

- Are the motors properly wired? This may be indicated by drift
- Are the ports correct? This may be indicated by other odd behavior
- Are the reversals correct? This may be indicated by one side seizing up

- Is the mode correct? This will affect motors
- Are any paths traced closed, or near-closed (start and end are close together)? If so, consider separating the paths into two or rerouting.
